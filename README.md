# Computational-Physics-Homework-2020
All homework programmed in C.
Because of the TAs had never publicized correct answers, I could not ensure everything is correct, or namely, standardized. Reports are uploaded along with codes, and algorithms are written with much details, hope that it would help.
Good luck & enjoy your study in this curriculum :rocket:  .
