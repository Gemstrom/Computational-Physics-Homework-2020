# Computational-Physics-Homework-2020
Computational Physics A was given by professor Zejun Ding, Xia Sun and Huimin Li, USTC. This curriculum has long been acknowledged for fierce inter-student competitions and time-consuming as well as a large amount of information in certain field. (Choose to keep the right of refusing to lay any personal comments on it, however.)
All homework is programmed in C.
Because the teaching assisstants had never publicized the correct answers, I could not ensure everything is correct, or namely, standardized. Reports are uploaded along with codes, and algorithms are written with much details, hope that it would help.
Good luck & enjoy your study in this curriculum :rocket:.
