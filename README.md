# Computational-Physics-Homework-2020
All homework is programmed in C.
Because the teaching assisstants had never publicized correct answers, I could not ensure everything is correct, or namely, standardized. Reports are uploaded along with codes, and algorithms are written with much details, hope that it would help.
Good luck & enjoy your study in this curriculum :rocket:.
